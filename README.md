# TelegramBot_with_ldap_auth

My own simple project
Based on [rubenlagus/TelegramBots](https://github.com/rubenlagus/TelegramBots)  
With [Keycloak](keycloak.org) authentication and role-based access using roles mapping from LDAP  
<dl>
  <dt>...an idea:
    <dd>
      <em>create the Bot, which will consolide all informational support of small business team:
        <ul>
          <li>easy info navigation in file shares of important usefull documents;
          <li>calendar of bookings of conference room;
          <li>internal events notifier;
          <li>administration functions for some people membered in special Active Directory group;
          <li>easy helpdesk for tech support, with database of tickets, statuses, timestamps, feedbacks etc., web-based frontend for tech personal and may be reports in future...;
        </ul>
      </em>
    </dd>  
    
In present state this project is only navigation menu template of the Bot with security ready
